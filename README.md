### Where to play

### How to play
Select the dimension of the grid and then paint the pixel with a color of your choice. You can swap colors while painting.

### Why I did this
This is a side-project for the udacity front-end nanodegree and coded from scratch.

### Credits
The color picker I used is the flexi-picker from David Durman, as the html5 picker is not well supported in all browsers. http://www.daviddurman.com/flexi-color-picker/

### Next improvements:
1. store the painted grid
2. user registration/login in order to
3. responsive design for screens up to 710px
4. send painted grid as a card with mail
